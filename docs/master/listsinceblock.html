listsinceblock ( "blockhash" target_confirmations include_watchonly include_removed )<br/><br/>Get all transactions in blocks since block [blockhash], or all transactions if omitted.<br/>If "blockhash" is no longer a part of the main chain, transactions from the fork point onward are included.<br/>Additionally, if include_removed is set, transactions affecting the wallet which were removed are returned in the "removed" array.<br/><br/>Arguments:<br/>1. "blockhash"            (string, optional) The block hash to list transactions since<br/>2. target_confirmations:    (numeric, optional, default=1) Return the nth block hash from the main chain. e.g. 1 would mean the best block hash. Note: this is not used as a filter, but only affects [lastblock] in the return value<br/>3. include_watchonly:       (bool, optional, default=false) Include transactions to watch-only addresses (see 'importaddress')<br/>4. include_removed:         (bool, optional, default=true) Show transactions that were removed due to a reorg in the "removed" array<br/>                                                           (not guaranteed to work on pruned nodes)<br/><br/>Result:<br/>{<br/>  "transactions": [<br/>    "address":"address",    (string) The bitcoin address of the transaction. Not present for move transactions (category = move).<br/>    "category":"send|receive",     (string) The transaction category. 'send' has negative amounts, 'receive' has positive amounts.<br/>    "amount": x.xxx,          (numeric) The amount in " + CURRENCY_UNIT + ". This is negative for the 'send' category, and for the 'move' category for moves <br/>                                          outbound. It is positive for the 'receive' category, and for the 'move' category for inbound funds.<br/>    "vout" : n,               (numeric) the vout value<br/>    "fee": x.xxx,             (numeric) The amount of the fee in " + CURRENCY_UNIT + ". This is negative and only available for the 'send' category of transactions.<br/>    "confirmations": n,       (numeric) The number of confirmations for the transaction. Available for 'send' and 'receive' category of transactions.<br/>                                          When it's < 0, it means the transaction conflicted that many blocks ago.<br/>    "blockhash": "hashvalue",     (string) The block hash containing the transaction. Available for 'send' and 'receive' category of transactions.<br/>    "blockindex": n,          (numeric) The index of the transaction in the block that includes it. Available for 'send' and 'receive' category of transactions.<br/>    "blocktime": xxx,         (numeric) The block time in seconds since epoch (1 Jan 1970 GMT).<br/>    "txid": "transactionid",  (string) The transaction id. Available for 'send' and 'receive' category of transactions.<br/>    "time": xxx,              (numeric) The transaction time in seconds since epoch (Jan 1 1970 GMT).<br/>    "timereceived": xxx,      (numeric) The time received in seconds since epoch (Jan 1 1970 GMT). Available for 'send' and 'receive' category of transactions.<br/>    "bip125-replaceable": "yes|no|unknown",  (string) Whether this transaction could be replaced due to BIP125 (replace-by-fee);<br/>                                                   may be unknown for unconfirmed transactions not in the mempool<br/>    "abandoned": xxx,         (bool) 'true' if the transaction has been abandoned (inputs are respendable). Only available for the 'send' category of transactions.<br/>    "comment": "...",       (string) If a comment is associated with the transaction.<br/>    "label" : "label"       (string) A comment for the address/transaction, if any<br/>    "to": "...",            (string) If a comment to is associated with the transaction.<br/>  ],<br/>  "removed": [<br/>    <structure is the same as "transactions" above, only present if include_removed=true><br/>    Note: transactions that were re-added in the active chain will appear as-is in this array, and may thus have a positive confirmation count.<br/>  ],<br/>  "lastblock": "lastblockhash"     (string) The hash of the block (target_confirmations-1) from the best block on the main chain. This is typically used to feed back into listsinceblock the next time you call it. So you would generally use a target_confirmations of say 6, so you will be continually re-notified of transactions until they've reached 6 confirmations plus any new ones<br/>}<br/><br/>Examples:<br/>> bitcoin-cli listsinceblock <br/>> bitcoin-cli listsinceblock "000000000000000bacf66f7497b7dc45ef753ee9a7d38571037cdb1a57f663ad" 6<br/>> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "listsinceblock", "params": ["000000000000000bacf66f7497b7dc45ef753ee9a7d38571037cdb1a57f663ad", 6] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:8332/<br/>
