sethdseed ( "newkeypool" "seed" )<br/><br/>Set or generate a new HD wallet seed. Non-HD wallets will not be upgraded to being a HD wallet. Wallets that are already<br/>HD will have a new HD seed set so that new keys added to the keypool will be derived from this new seed.<br/><br/>Note that you will need to MAKE A NEW BACKUP of your wallet after setting the HD wallet seed.<br/>
