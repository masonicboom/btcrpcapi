bumpfee "txid" ( options ) <br/><br/>Bumps the fee of an opt-in-RBF transaction T, replacing it with a new transaction B.<br/>An opt-in RBF transaction with the given txid must be in the wallet.<br/>The command will pay the additional fee by decreasing (or perhaps removing) its change output.<br/>If the change output is not big enough to cover the increased fee, the command will currently fail<br/>instead of adding new inputs to compensate. (A future implementation could improve this.)<br/>The command will fail if the wallet or mempool contains a transaction that spends one of T's outputs.<br/>By default, the new fee will be calculated automatically using estimatefee.<br/>The user can specify a confirmation target for estimatefee.<br/>Alternatively, the user can specify totalFee, or use RPC setpaytxfee to set a higher fee rate.<br/>At a minimum, the new fee rate must be high enough to pay an additional new relay fee (incrementalfee<br/>returned by getnetworkinfo) to enter the node's mempool.<br/><br/>Arguments:<br/>1. txid                  (string, required) The txid to be bumped<br/>2. options               (object, optional)<br/>   {<br/>     "confTarget"        (numeric, optional) Confirmation target (in blocks)<br/>     "totalFee"          (numeric, optional) Total fee (NOT feerate) to pay, in satoshis.<br/>                         In rare cases, the actual fee paid might be slightly higher than the specified<br/>                         totalFee if the tx change output has to be removed because it is too close to<br/>                         the dust threshold.<br/>     "replaceable"       (boolean, optional, default true) Whether the new transaction should still be<br/>                         marked bip-125 replaceable. If true, the sequence numbers in the transaction will<br/>                         be left unchanged from the original. If false, any input sequence numbers in the<br/>                         original transaction that were less than 0xfffffffe will be increased to 0xfffffffe<br/>                         so the new transaction will not be explicitly bip-125 replaceable (though it may<br/>                         still be replacable in practice, for example if it has unconfirmed ancestors which<br/>                         are replaceable).<br/>   }<br/><br/>Result:<br/>{<br/>  "txid":    "value",   (string)  The id of the new transaction<br/>  "origfee":  n,         (numeric) Fee of the replaced transaction<br/>  "fee":      n,         (numeric) Fee of the new transaction<br/>  "errors":  [ str... ] (json array of strings) Errors encountered during processing (may be empty)<br/>}<br/><br/>Examples:<br/>
